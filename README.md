# MatrixCSS
The goal of this project is to create the Matrix Rain effect using CSS3 for animation and depth, and JQuery to dynamically adapt to screen height and speed.

A proof of concept can be found on [CodePen](http://codepen.io/choodex/pen/mEjLBB). It was inspired by [this CodePen](http://codepen.io/P3R0/pen/MwgoKv) by Ebram Marzouk, which is an eloquent solution utilizing HTML5 canvas and JS.

## To Use

From command line:

```bash
# Install dependencies and run the app
npm install && npm start
```

If electron is not installed globally, there may be issues running the npm start command. If so, then run the following command instead:

```bash
./node_modules/.bin/electron .
```
